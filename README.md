# Read

Read code, get better.

## Why

Reading good stuff is a good way to figure out how to write good stuff. As coders, we spend a lot of time reading code but there's no training out there to help us do it well. Even a 10% improvement at a programmer's ability to read code would translate into significant time savings in a short space of time.

## How to use

1. Fork this repo.
2. Make a new branch for a new exercise. Name the branch `<exercise-number>-<your-github-handle>`.
3. Add comments to the exercise using your text editor, explaining what the code does.
4. Commit the commented code. Make the commit title `<exercise-number>`. In your commit message, write what the code does at a high level.
5. Push it to your forked repo.
6. Make a PR from your forked repo `<exercise-number>-<your-github-handle>` branch to the master of the origin repo (https://github.com/sjmog/read).
7. Browse PRs in the origin repo to see what others thought about the code (click the PR, then click "Files Changed"). You can filter PRs by the exercise number. You can discuss PRs in the discussion.

## How

MVP.

- Load a file by cloning a GH repo containing some examples
- Add line-by-line comments with a text editor
- Add a file-wide comment with a commit
- Can see others’ solutions by making a PR and viewing pull requests

## Roadmap

Overall idea:

- Can load up a random new file
- Can do line-by-line comments explaining what something is and how it works
- Can do a file-wide comment
- Can see others’ approaches and discuss

Clearly, some sort of web app would be a good basis to get started. Some sort of open-source [code review tool](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/top-5-open-source-and-commercial-secure-code-review-tools) might accelerate development.
